	During the workshop in Amsterdam we decided that this message caused

	works just fine without the base_url parameter.

	* Release: 2.2.0
	- Removed support for types fetch, embed, stream and link.

2006-11-23  German Cancio Melia

	- Fix Savannah #10558: Do skip over profile diff step when --force is set, in order to inconditionally update the CCM cache even if the new profile does not differ from the old one.

        * Release: 1.5.2

2005-08-18  Juan Antonio LOPEZ PEREZ

        * Release: 1.4.29
        - Corrected Solaris postinstall script
	   - In Solaris, ccm-fetch will not work unless we add /usr/local/lib
	   to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and the cron jobs don't use the system 
	   environment. In addition, the Solaris cron doesn't accept to set
	   environment variables for cron jobs except the PATH one. Then, I 
	   modified the crontab entry to add this directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	   and to export it each time it runs the command. 
	   - I also modified it to restart the cron daemon at most once to
	   run the script faster.
	   - In addition, I made some other minor corrections to the scripts.

2005-07-21  Juan Antonio LOPEZ PEREZ

        * Release: 1.4.25
        - Made some changes for Solaris compatibility to 
	take into account the different Solaris cron system. 
	For that, I wrote a postinstall and a preunistall script
	to add the contrab entries of the ccm-fetch.cron and the
	ccm-purge.cron files to the Solaris root crontab file
	(/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root) and to remove them when
	the EDGccm package is uninstalled.
